# Why?
_Performance for [stable-diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) on MacOS/iPadOS is not that great, many people are building dedicated Windows systems with high-end GPU's, and that's great but I think we can do better._

What about using locally a remote Nvidia H100 ($40,000 GPU) at $1,90 per hour?

You can launch a payload that will run everything for you, including the ssh tunnel. I will add more than Fooocus, but currently is the one I'm using, feel free to add others.

It'll atuomatically open a tab on your browser when it's done installing everything and doing the tunnel
