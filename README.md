# Why?
_Performance for [stable-diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) on MacOS/iPadOS is not that great, many people are building dedicated Windows systems with high-end GPU's, and that's great but I think we can do better._

What about using locally a remote Nvidia H100 ($40,000 GPU) at $1,90 per hour?
