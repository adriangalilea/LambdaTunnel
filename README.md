# Why?
_Performance for [stable-diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) on MacOS/iPadOS is not that great, many people are building dedicated Windows systems with high-end GPU's, and that's great but I think we can do better._

What about using locally a remote Nvidia H100 ($40,000 GPU) at $2,40 per hour?

# Prerequisites
- An account on Lambda Cloud. (You can create it meanwhile.)
- ~~An SSH key pair that you can use to connect to your Lambda Cloud instance.~~ ‚úîÔ∏è fast_setup.sh

# Fast set-up if you hate security
_This is only for the brave ones that trust random people on the internet, definitely a bad idea and you should exercise more caution from now on.
But thanks for the trust I guess. :) ‚ù§Ô∏è_ 

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adriangalilea/LambdaTunnel/main/fast_setup.sh)
```
Follow the prompts in the terminal. The script will ask for the IP address of your Lambda Cloud instance, create an SSH tunnel, and mount the instance's filesystem on your local machine.
Once the script has finished running, you can access the stable-diffusion UI at http://localhost:7860.

I'm not affiliated in any way shape or form to Lambdalabs... yet üòú

### setup time
Notice that the setup time might take ~15 minutes that's not counting you installing extensions/models from civit.ai, this means you'll pay for this setup time too, this is meant for serious work or enthusiasts, if you think this is too much this means this is not for you.

### WARNING
BE SURE TO CLOSE THE INSTANCE WHEN YOU ARE DONE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE SESSION BY SHUTTING DOWN THE SERVER BUT LAMBDALABS DON'T ALLOW THIS, I'M SHOUTING IN HOPES YOU SAVE SOME HARD EARNED CASH, IF YOU ARE READING THIS AFTER HAVING SPENT A BUNCH OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU WENT TO SLEEP AND FORGOT, I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S YOUR FAULT <3, THANKS FOR LISTENING TO MY TED-TALK.

For better security, consider cloning this repository and running the script locally:
```bash

cd LambdaGPU-Helper
bash connect_to_server.sh
```
Or even better read how to do it manually:

# Manual set-up for my fellow tin-foil hat club.
__This is the way to go champ, you did the right thing, now treat yourself and go execute the above random command for the fast set-up that you won't even bother double-checking.__ üëÄ

1. [SSH key pair setup](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/ssh-keys)
2. Spin up the [lambdalabs instance](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/instances)
3. Wait until it's done loading and copy the ssh command
4. Connect to the instance through SSH on a terminal
5. (Optional) use tmux to install [stable-diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
6. Once Stable diffusion is finishing installing and is running exit tmux with `ctrl+b -> d` for detaching from tmux and leave stable diffusion running.
7. Create an ssh tunnel for the port stable diffusion uses 7860
8. For convenience you could connect to the remote server through filezilla or duck
